# CardInventory

## Information

This is an ASP.NET MVC project. I used Entityframework and SQL Server to handle database creation, data management, and schema changes. Bootstrap was used for the website CSS framework. I started to use Jquery and javascript to add advanced clientside functionality.

## Current Features
* Users must authenticate by logging in with username and password
* Create, update and delete decks
* Create, update and delete cards
* Partially complete - adding a card to a deck using Jquery

## Future Ideas
* From the card view show what decks it belongs to
* Hook into external card api to pull in card information
* Further define card schema(Pokemon/MTG/Digimon)
